 // --- Preprocessor Directives (#include) ---
 // These lines tell the compiler to include code from the C++ Standard Library
 // that we need to use in our program.

#include <iostream> // For standard input/output operations (like writing to the console with std::cout).
#include <fstream>  // For file stream operations, specifically for reading files (std::ifstream).
#include <string>   // For using the std::string class to handle text data.
#include <vector>   // For using the std::vector container. While not used in this initial version,
                    // we will need it soon to store our parsed log data.

// --- Main Function ---
// This is the starting point of every C++ program. Execution begins here.
// The `int argc` and `char* argv[]` parameters are used to receive command-line arguments.
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    // --- Command-Line Argument Validation ---
    // A professional command-line tool should always validate its input.
    // 'argc' (argument count) stores the number of arguments passed.
    // 'argv' (argument vector) is an array of C-style strings containing the arguments.
    // The first argument (argv[0]) is always the name of the program itself.
    // We expect exactly one more argument: the path to the log file.
    // Therefore, argc should be exactly 2.
    if (argc != 2) {
        // We use std::cerr for error messages. It's the standard error stream.
        // This is good practice as it separates error output from normal program output.
        std::cerr << "Error: Incorrect number of arguments." << std::endl;
        std::cerr << "Usage: " << argv[0] << " <path_to_log_file>" << std::endl;
        return 1; // Returning a non-zero value from main() indicates that the program terminated with an error.
    }

    // Store the log file path from the command-line arguments into a C++ std::string.
    std::string logFilePath = argv[1];

    // Announce the start of the program. This provides good user feedback.
    std::cout << "Initializing Log File Analyzer..." << std::endl;
    std::cout << "------------------------------------" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Target log file: " << logFilePath << std::endl;

    // --- File Handling ---
    // Create an input file stream object. The constructor takes the file path.
    // 'ifstream' stands for 'Input File Stream'.
    std::ifstream logFile(logFilePath);

    // CRITICAL: Always check if the file was successfully opened before trying to read it.
    // The .is_open() method returns 'false' if the file couldn't be found or opened for any reason.
    if (!logFile.is_open()) {
        std::cerr << "Fatal Error: Could not open the log file at: " << logFilePath << std::endl;
        return 1; // Exit with an error code.
    }

    std::cout << "File opened successfully. Starting analysis..." << std::endl;

    // --- Reading the File Line-by-Line ---
    std::string currentLine;
    long long lineCounter = 0; // Use long long for potentially very large files.

    // This is the most memory-efficient way to read a large file.
    // The 'while' loop continues as long as std::getline is able to read a new line from the file.
    // It reads one line at a time into the 'currentLine' string, overwriting its previous content.
    // This means we only ever store one line in memory at any given moment.
    while (std::getline(logFile, currentLine)) {
        lineCounter++;
        // In the next phase, we will add code *inside this loop* to parse 'currentLine'.
    }

    // --- Program Completion ---
    // When the 'logFile' object goes out of scope at the end of 'main', its destructor
    // is automatically called, which safely closes the file. This is a core C++
    // principle called RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization), which helps prevent resource leaks.

    std::cout << "Analysis finished." << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Total lines processed: " << lineCounter << std::endl;
    std::cout << "------------------------------------" << std::endl;

    return 0; // Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
